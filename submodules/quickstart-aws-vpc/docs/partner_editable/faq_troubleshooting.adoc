== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation^].


== Troubleshooting

The following table lists specific *CREATE_FAILED* error messages you might encounter.

|===
|Error message|Possible cause|What to do

|*API: ec2: RunInstances Not authorized for images: ami-ID*|The template is referencing an AMI that has expired.|We refresh AMIs on a regular basis, but our schedule isn’t always synchronized with AWS AMI updates. If you get this error message, notify us, and we’ll update the template with the new AMI ID.

If you’d like to fix the template yourself, you can https://fwd.aws/px53q[download it] and update the `Mappings` section with the latest AMI ID for your region.
|*We currently do not have sufficient t2.small capacity in the AZ you requested*|The NAT instance requires a larger or different instance type|Switch to an instance type that supports higher capacity. If a higher-capacity instance type isn’t available, try a different Availability Zone or region. Or you can complete the https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-[request form] in the AWS Support Center to increase the Amazon EC2 limit for the instance type or region. Limit increases are tied to the region they were requested for.
|*Instance ID did not stabilize*|You have exceeded your IOPS for the region.|Request a limit increase by completing the https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-[request form] in the AWS Support Center.

If you encounter a template validation error during deployment, check for a mismatch in the values of the *Availability Zones* and *Number of Availability Zones* parameters. If you select more Availability Zones than you request, the AWS CloudFormation template won’t validate. Correct the parameters so that they’re in sync, and redeploy the Quick Start.
