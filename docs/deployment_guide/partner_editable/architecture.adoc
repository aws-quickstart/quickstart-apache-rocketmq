As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans up to three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances for Apache RocketMQ NameServers. You can deploy 1â€“3 NameServer nodes. The default is three (shown).
** Apache RocketMQ web console running on each Apache NameServer instance.
** EC2 instances for Apache RocketMQ Broker servers. You can deploy either one or three Broker server nodes. The default is three (shown).
