=== Logging into an Apache RocketMQ NameServer or Broker server node

. Add a PEM key pair. For example:

[source,bash]
--
ssh-add -k /Users/username/tmp/rocketmqXXX.pem
--

[start=2]
. Sign into the bastion host.

[source,bash]
--
ssh -A  ec2-user@ecXXXXXXXX.cn-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com.cn
--

:xrefstyle: short
[start=3]
. Get the IP address from the Amazon EC2 console.
.. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2 console].
.. On the *Instances* screen, select the checkbox for the instance. Note the *Private IPs* in the *Description* tab, as shown in <<IPaddress>>.

[#IPaddress]
.EC2 instance private IP address

[start=4]
. From the bastion host, log into the node with the IP address. For example:

[source,bash]
----
(ec2-user@ip-10-0-136-135) $ ssh 10.0.6.235

Last login: Wed Jan  6 04:55:01 2021 from ip-10-0-136-135.cn-north-1.compute.internal

       _|  (     /   Amazon Linux 2 AMI
      ___|\___|___|
https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/

[ec2-user@ip-10-0-6-235 ~]$
----

[start=5]
. Once you are signed into the node, you can use https://rocketmq.apache.org/docs/cli-admin-tool/[Apache RocketMQ command-line tools] to query, manage, and diagnose issues.

=== Viewing the Apache RocketMQ web console in a browser

The default deployment installs the web console on Apache name servers. However, as Apache name servers run in the private subnets, they cannot be accessed directly through a browser. To access port 8080 of the private IP address of the Apache name server, configure an SSH connection with the bastion host SSH tunnel. Then use the SSH tunnel to access the web console. 

. Establish a connection with the bastion host using SSH with the following command. Replace `_port number_`, `_key pair.pem_`, `_user name_`, and `_host name_` with your parameters.

+
`ssh -qTfnN -D _port number_ -i "_key pair.pem_" _user name_@_host name_`

+
For example:

+
`ssh -qTfnN -D 40011  -i "rocketMQ.pem" \ec2-user@ec2-54-223-36-247.cn-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com.cn`

. Set up a proxy manager in your browser. There are many proxy manager plug-ins available. These instructions use SwitchyOmega.
.. Install the SwitchyOmega plug-in.
** https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/proxy-switchyomega/fdbloeknjpnloaggplaobopplkdhnikc?hl=en-US[Microsoft Edge]
** https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switchyomega/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search[Firefox]
** https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif?hl=en-US[Google Chrome]

+

.. Open the SwitchyOmega options page and select *New Profile* in the left sidebar.

+

+
[start=3]
.. Enter a name and select *Create*.

+

image::../images/switchyOmega2.png[SwitchyOmega,width=50%,height=50%]

+
[start=4]
.. Enter the information for proxy server, as shown below, and click on the apple changes at the bottom left, noting that the value for port needs to be set to the local port where you set up the ssh tunnel, see the number after the first step "-D" parameter, as shown below:
.. Click on the SwitchyOmega plug-in and select the RocketMQ profile you just created, as shown below:

+

image::../images/switchyOmega4.png[SwitchyOmega,width=50%,height=50%]

+
[start=8]
. After completing this step above, the browser will send all traffic through the local port 40011 proxy to the Bastion  Host machine.
. Enter the private IP address of any of the deployed Nameservers in your browser plus port 8080 (for example:http://10.0.xx.xx:8080), and you can find the corresponding instance for the nameserver via EC2 Console and find the corresponding IP address, as shown below:

+
image::../images/ec2.png[ec2,width=90%,height=90%]
[start=10]
. The browser should be able to display the deployed RocketMQ cluster properly, as shown in the following image:
