*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance keeps running so that you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)
// Customize this answer if needed. For example, if you’re deploying on Linux instances, either provide the location for log files on Linux or omit the final sentence. If the Quick Start has no EC2 instances, revise accordingly (something like "and the assets keep running").

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].


== Troubleshooting
* I cannot access the Apache RocketMQ web console.
** The Apache RocketMQ web Console runs on an Apache NameServer host in a private subnet. Verify that the SSH tunnel from your desktop to the bastion host is set up to connect to the Apache NameServer.
** If the SSH tunnel is setup correctly, but you still cannot open the web console, it is possible that the web console did not start properly. Log in to the NameServer and check the install log file at `/home/ec2-user/rocketmq-deploy/install.log`.
* The Apache RocketMQ Broker server cluster does not show up in the Apache RocketMQ web console.
** Log in to the Broker server node and check the Broker node install log in `/home/ec2-user/rocketmq-deploy/install.log`. You can submit an issue to the Quick Start GitHub https://fwd.aws/wJrW8[repository] for assistance. Include the error log with your submission.
* How can I access the Apache RocketMQ internal logs?
** On the NameServers and Broker servers, the internal Apache RocketMQ logs are found in `/home/ec2-user/rocketmq-deploy/`.
