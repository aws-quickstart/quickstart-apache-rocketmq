image::../images/apache-rocketmq-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans up to three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances for Apache RocketMQ NameServers. You can deploy a NameServer cluster containing 1â€“3 nodes.
** Apache RocketMQ web console deployed on each Apache NameServer instance.
** EC2 instances for Apache RocketMQ Broker servers. You can deploy a Broker cluster of one or three nodes (shown).
