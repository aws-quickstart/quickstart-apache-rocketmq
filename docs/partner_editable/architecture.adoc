image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two to three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Apache RocketMQ NameServer EC2 instances(can be up to three NameServer EC2 Instances).
** Apache RocketMQ Broker EC2 instances(can be 1 or 3 Broker EC2 Instances).
** Apache RocketMQ WebConsole is deployed on the NameServer Instances.
